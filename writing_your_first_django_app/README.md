that's my work for the official django tut, found at:

https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.7/intro/tutorial01/

I've finished it except for additional part of creating a python reusable package (don't feel like anybody needs an app from tutorial - although maybe several dozens might have published anyway)

Some things were left as special tasks:

	part 5: 
	(https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.7/intro/tutorial05/)
	[*] ideas for more tests

I found no value in finishing this, got the idea of testing in Django and know others ways for pure python.

FIN
